jekyll-case-url
===============

Implements a `{% case_url tag %}` to use in Jekyll.

Imagine that you want to be able to mention a case in a web enabled change management system. It could be that you are contribution to Jenkins CI and want to be mention cases in the Jenkins CI issue tracking system

like:

`https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19823`

---

In the `_config.yml` file add then the path leading up to the case ID as a Â´case_path` entry:

    case_path: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/
    
In your MarkDown you can now mention this case like this:

    Case {% case_url JENKINS-19823%} was about improving performance

Which will then render to:

    Case <a class="case" 
    href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19823">
    JENKINS-19823</a> was about improving performance

---

Case <a class="case" href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19823">JENKINS-19823</a> was about improving performance

---

Note that the `<a>` tag is preset with the `class="case"` it allows you to do cool stuff in you cascading stylesheet.

Have a look at the css sample provided it will color the link "Jira blue" and tail it with the characteristic Jira joggler. It will render something like this:

__To install simply create a folder named `_plugins` in your Jekyll site and copy the `case-url.rb` file to it.__
